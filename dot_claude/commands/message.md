Analyze the staged changes and generate an appropriate commit message:

!git diff --cached

Based on the staged changes above, generate a concise commit message that:
1. Starts with a capital verb in present tense, imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove")
2. Focuses on the "why" rather than the "what" 
3. Is 1-2 sentences maximum

If no staged changes are found, suggest staging files first with `git add`.
